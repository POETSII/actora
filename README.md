# Actora

Modern processors spend huge numbers of transistors on the
identification of instruction-level parallelism and the provision of
coherent shared memories.  But for applications conforming to the
actor model, parallelism is abundant, blindingly explicit, and without
shared state.

Actora is processor designed to support the actor model more directly,
using of large number of very simple cores running code written in
a small Erlang-like language called Elite.  The work is in the
preliminary stages.  So far, we have:

  * [Elite](compiler/Syntax.hs),
     a small Erlang-like language (no concurrency features yet!)
  * [Compiler](compiler/CBackend.hs)
    from Elite to C (runs on x86 and NIOS-II)
  * [Actora bytecode](#6-actora-bytecode),
    a custom stack-machine ISA for Elite
  * [Compiler](compiler/Compiler.hs) from Elite to Actora bytecode
  * [Emulator](emulator/actemu.cpp) for Actora bytecode
  * [Benchmarks](benchmarks/) written in Elite
  * [Comparison](#4-hipe-versus-elite-c-backend)
    of the Elite C Backend and the
    High-Performance Erlang Compiler (HIPE)
  * [Space-optimised Actora Core](rtl/Core.hs)
    implementation on FPGA
    (in [Blarney](https://github.com/mn416/blarney))
  * [Comparison](#5-elite-c-backend-versus-actora-core)
    of Actora core and NIOS-II on DE5-Net and DE10-Pro FPGAs

Below, there are some more details about what's been done so far.

## 1. Elite C Backend

This is a C code generator that performs a like-for-like mapping from
Erlang functions to C functions, and from Erlang variables to C
variables.  As a result, it is both simple and efficient, exploiting
the optimisation capabilities of the C compiler, such as tail-call
optimisation, inlining, common subexpression elimination, and many
more.  However, a big drawback of the approach is that the garbage
collector must be *conservative* since pointers and integers cannot be
distinguished in C.  This also means that the garbage collector cannot
relocate objects, preventing the use of copying collectors, operating
in O(survivors) time, that work well for functional languages.  The
generated C code runs on both x86 and NIOS-II architectures.

## 2. Actora Core

This is a simple [stack machine](/doc/ISA.md) with a 3-stage pipeline
(Fetch, Decode, Execute).  It has separate memories for instructions,
stack data, and heap data.  The stack is implemented using a dual-port
RAM, allowing two stack elements to be accessed per cycle.  The heap
memory is two cells wide, since almost all heap objects contain at
least two cells.  Cells on the stack and heap are both tagged with
type information.  The tags of pointer cells contain further
information about the object pointed-to, such as its length and arity
(if it is a closure), often allowing patterns to be matched and types
to be checked without having to dereference. The core supports a set
of ALU primitives similar to those available on the NIOS-II.  It also
includes a fast copying garbage collector, implemented as a small
state-machine in hardware.  The compiler from Elite to stack code is
small and straightforward.

## 3. Elite Benchmarks

The following benchmarks are mostly representative of symbolic
functional programs, with plenty of pattern matching, recursion,
dynamic and persistent data structures.  One exception is *shiftsub*,
which is a tight tail-recursive loop with only primitive operations,
and should favour a register machine.

Benchmark | Description
--------- | -----------
[fib](/benchmarks/fib.erl) | Standard doubly-recursive fibonacci function
[adjoxo](/benchmarks/adjoxo.erl) | Adjudicator for naughts and crosses, involving sets as lists
[mss](/benchmarks/mss.erl) | Basic maximum segment sum function on lists
[redblack](/benchmarks/redblack.erl) | Insertion and membership functions on Red-Black trees
[while](/benchmarks/while.erl) | Operational semantics for a simple imperative language
[braun](/benchmarks/braun.erl) | Insertion and flattening functions on Braun trees
[queens](/benchmarks/queens.erl) | N-queens solver using success/fail continuation passing style
[shiftsub](/benchmarks/shiftsub.erl) | Binary long division

For further examples of Elite programs, see the [test suite](tests/).

## 4. HIPE versus Elite C Backend

We would like to use code generated by the Elite C Backend running on
the NIOS-II as a baseline to compare the performance the Actora Core.
Before that, it is useful to establish whether the Elite C Backend is
actually representative of the performance of existing Erlang
compilers.  We do this by comparing against **HIPE**, the
high-performance Erlang compiler, on an x86 machine.

Benchmark | HIPE (s) | Elite C backend (s) | GC (%) | Speedup
--------- | ----:    | -----:              | -----: | ------:
fib       | 1.06     |  1.02               | 0      |  1.03
adjoxo    | 0.40     |  0.39               | 38.40  |  1.02
mss       | 0.71     |  0.24               | 0.01   |  2.95
redblack  | 0.35     |  0.37               | 30.00  |  0.94
while     | 0.27     |  0.34               | 50.00  |  0.79
braun     | 0.21     |  0.33               | 45.45  |  0.63
queens    | 0.72     |  0.29               | 0.03   |  2.48
shiftsub  | 0.85     |  0.27               | 0      |  3.14

These results were obtained from an `Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6770HQ CPU @
2.60GHz`.  The Elite C backend was given a 1MB heap.  The GC column
shows the proportion of time spent in the garbage collector
for the Elite C backend, not HIPE.

The results show that the Elite C backend is generally more efficient
than HIPE.  It falls slightly short only in the heap-intensive
benchmarks, were GC time (a known weakness) is significant.  It is
possible that we could improve GC time by using LLVM as a target
instead of C (allowing pointers and integers to be distinguished).

## 5. Elite C Backend versus Actora Core

The Actora Core is slightly larger than a NIOS-II, and has a lower Fmax:

Implementation | DE5-Net Area (ALMs) | DE5-Net FMax (MHz)
-------------- | -----------------:  | -----------------:
NIOS-II        | 850 (0.0036%)       | 323
Elite core     | 1087 (0.0046%)      | 254     

Implementation | DE10-Pro Area (ALMs) | DE10-Pro FMax (MHz)
-------------- | ------------------:  | ------------------:
NIOS-II        | 1154 (0.0012%)       | 345
Elite core     | 1229 (0.0013%)       | 301     

Despite the lower Fmax, the Actora Core offers a slight performance
improvement (results for DE5-Net, both implementations use a 56KB
heap):

Benchmark | NIOS-II (s) | GC (%) | Elite core (s) | %GC    | Speedup
--------- | ----------: | -----: | -------------: | -----: | ------:
fib       |   35.92     |      0 |  18.90         |     0  |  1.90
adjoxo    |   11.42     |  41.70 |   3.99         |  2.35  |  2.86
mss       |    7.81     |   1.97 |   4.73         |  0.23  |  1.65
redblack  |   11.26     |  39.47 |   4.86         |  7.87  |  2.31
while     |   12.12     |  42.65 |   3.30         |  2.31  |  3.67
braun     |   11.97     |  55.40 |   2.92         | 15.10  |  4.10
queens    |    7.89     |   3.80 |   6.09         |  0.10  |  1.30
shiftsub  |    7.41     |      0 |   4.76         |     0  |  1.55

Again, the difference is most visible in the benchmarks where GC time
is significant, which is a known weakness of the C backend (which
could probably be improved using a more sophisticated LLVM backend
instead).

The Actora Core is quite a modest attempt at a language-specific CPU in
the sense that aims to keep logic usage down -- we want to fit as many
instances of this core on an FPGA as we can.  But that goal has
resulted in only a modest performance improvement over a
space-optimised RISC core.

+------+--------+---------+----------+
```

The 5-bit condition `cond` on the top stack element, which may be
negated using the `neg` bit, has the following format.


  * `00000` - Is top a function pointer?
  * `00001` - Is top an int with value == signExtend(data)?
  * `00010` - Is top an atom with value == zeroExtend(data)?
  * `00100` - Is top a pointer to a cons constructor?
  * `00101` - Is top a pointer to a tuple of length data?
  * `00110` - Is top a pointer to a closure of arity data?

**CJumpPop**: Conditional jump and pop from stack based on condition
flag.  If the jump is taken, a given number of items are popped from
the stack.

```
25     21       16
+------+--------+----------+
| 0000 | pop<6> | addr<16> |

**ShiftRight**: Replace the top two stack elements with the first
element logically shifted right by the second element.

```
25          15
+------------+------------+
| 1001000100 | unused<16> |
+------------+------------+
```

**AShiftRight**: Replace the top two stack elements with the first
